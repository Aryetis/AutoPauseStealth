# AutoPauseStealth

## Description :

Automatically and stealthly pause your game at the start of every song waiting for potential lag spikes to end.

----------

## Why ?

If you're lagging at the start of some songs every once in a while for no reasons.
Then check this guide first : https://bsmg.wiki/support/#framerate-issues
You've done of the steps mentioned in it? You bought a new computer especially to get rid of lags? You even sacrificed some virgins ? ... Should I get the police involved?
Ok so you can't rid of the startup lags, then try this mod as a last resort.

----------

## Settings :

What are those ?
![InGameSettings](https://github.com/Aryetis/AutoPauseStealth/blob/master/AutoPauseStealth/Resources/SettingsMenuInGame.png)

[Autoset Min FPS], will automatically set the [Desired Minimal FPS] value based on your headset refreshrate.

[Desired Minimal FPS], FPS value to reach what is considered a stable framerate.

[FPS Stability Check Duration], FPS must be above [Desired Minimal FPS] for that much seconds before the mod will start the song.

[Force GameStart duration], It's a railguard. If somehow your computer can't reach a stable framerate at start under [Force GameStart duration] seconds, then it will start the song anyways.

----------

## How do I know if it works ?

Well if it works correctly you shouldn't notice it, otherwise it wouldn't be stealth would it.
Okay okay... If it works correctly you should be missing your sabers at the beginning of the song for [FPS Stability Check Duration] seconds.
