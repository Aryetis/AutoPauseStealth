**AutoPauseStealth v0.1.17**

Game randomly lags at the beginning of a song ? Tried everything in the sacred scrolls <https://bsmg.wiki/support/#framerate-issues> ? 
Give this mod a try, it will automatically pause your game at startup for a fraction of a second. Giving your computer time to catch up and finish loading everything properly, all the while without showing you the pause UI. You can configure how long you want the game to pause, what amount of fps to target, automatically reload the song if game refuses to stabilise, etc... Check mod setting's page at "Settings-> mod settings->AutoPauseStealth"
